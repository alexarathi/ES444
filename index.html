            <p id = 'about'> "A movement is afoot.
It reaches across sectors and across geographies, linking small-business
loans in Detroit with community development financing in Delhi." It has
animated a generation of entrepreneurs and captured the imagination of world
leaders. It links the social consciousness of philanthropy with the market
principles of business. It’s about how the power of markets can help to scale
solutions to some of our most urgent problems.
The movement is called impact investing. It brings together entrepreneurs,
investors, foundations, public-sector leaders, nonprofits, and intermediaries
to use private capital for public good. Simply put, impact investing generates
measurable, beneficial social or environmental impacts alongside financial
returns. It’s a simple idea with profound implications. For all the media coverage impact investing has earned recently, it is not
a new concept. It has deep historical roots. Impact investing was built in
partnership among investors, foundations, and the US government over the
course of decades. Today, impact investors finance undertakings from early
childhood education to global economic development, from preventive
health care services to village-based solar microgrids. "</p>
