    <h2>MITIGATIONS</h2>
    <p style = "text-align: left">1. The term "impact investing" has become popular, even trendy. One important way to help the trend become a constant is through education itself. It is said that impact investment firms significantly outperformed traditional bets during the coronavirus pandemic.Encouring folks to buy from sustainably made brands and be more meaningful with the way they purchase is the other part of the cycle. Educating both investors and the general public </p>
    <p style = "text-align: left">2. Smart public policy can galvanize impact investing. In order for there to be a strong delta, a much more intentional and proactive partnership between both the government and the private sector. 
        <ul style = "text-align: left"> - Remove regulatory barriers </ul>
        <ul style = "text-align: left"> - Increase the effectiveness of government programs </ul>
        <ul style = "text-align: left"> - Provide incentives for new private impact investments</ul></p>
    <p style = "text-align: left">3. Similar to how chocolate bars have labels on calorie count and sugar content, why don't companies have to have the same for clothes, softwares, etc.? Having labels describing how much CO2 was emitted or what workers were paid to make the product. Creating a platform that shows how sustainably managed companies are would allow for a lot more transparency.</p>
    <p style = "text-align: left">4. One of the toughest parts about impact investing is defining what impact actually means. There are numerous ways to measure it which often disuades people from thinking too much about it, or only caring about a certain cause. Creating universal definitions for the term is essential to change. </p>
